Go swimming. It’s a nice day out, and you have been walking for a while. What different would a few extra minutes make?/~/064
Don’t go swimming. You shouldn’t swim alone. Also, you should be bringing the pretty flowers and the basket of goodies to Grandmother. Who knows, maybe Grandmother will take you to the lake to swim later./~/061
