Go swimming. It's a nice day out, and you have been walking for a while. What difference would a few extra minutes make?^016
Don't go swimming. You shouldn't swim alone in the forest. Also, you should be bringing the pretty flowers and the basket of goodies to Grandmother. Who knows, maybe Grandmother will take you to the lake to swim later.^011
