After playing for a little while longer, you walk inside and are met by your angry Mother.
Mother: Hello Little Red. Bring this basket of goodies to Grandmother. Make sure you hurry as to not make Grandmother wait too long. Also, make sure to stay on the trail!
You takes the basket from Mother and goes on her way down the trail.
