After playing for a little while longer, you walk inside and are met by your angry Mother.
Mother: Little Red, bring this basket of bread and wine to Grandmother. Hurry now, as you've already kept Grandmother waiting. Also, be sure to stay on the trail!
You take the basket from Mother and scurry along down the trail.
