As the hungry Wolf jumps out of bed you throw the basket of goodies at him to slow him down. Then you run out of the bedroom and out of the house slamming both doors behind you to slow him down even more. You find some of Grandmother’s neighbor friends. You tell them that the hungry Wolf just ate Grandmother. The Towns People run back toward Grandmother’s house and find the Wolf. Together they kill the Wolf.
