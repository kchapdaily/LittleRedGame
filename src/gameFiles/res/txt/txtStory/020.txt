After you cut off the Fox's paw, he runs off. You continue on to Grandmother's house. When you reach Grandmother's house you see that the front door is wide open. It's a nice day outside and you assume Grandmother has the door open to let in the fresh air. You walk in but you don't see Grandmother. You walk into her bedroom and see her in bed where she appears to be sleeping. Then you notice that her hand has been cut off. You realize Grandmother is the hungry Fox! You yell and Grandmother wakes up. She turns into the Fox and starts to come after you.
What do you do?
