You arrive at Grandmother's house and knock on the door. In a weird voice you hear Grandmother.
Grandmother: Come in.
You open the door but you don't see Grandmother. You cautiously walk into Grandmother's bedroom. She is in bed. You think that she is sick and how this explains the weird voice. Grandmother doesn't look like herself. You tell Grandmother that she has big eyes, arms, and ears. After that you tell Grandmother that she has big teeth.
Grandmother: All the better to EAT YOU WITH!
Then Grandmother jumps out of bed, but it's not Grandmother. It's the hungry Wolf! What do you do?
