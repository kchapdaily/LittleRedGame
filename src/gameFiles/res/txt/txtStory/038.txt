After you cut off the hungry Fox's paw, the Fox runs off. You continue on to Grandmother's house. When you get to Grandmother's house you see that the front door is wide open. It�s a nice day outside and you think Grandmother has the door open to let in the nice air. You walk in but you don�t see Grandmother. You walk into Grandmother�s room and see her in bed. She looks to be sleeping. Then you notice that her hand has been cut off. You realize Grandmother is the hungry Fox! You yell. Grandmother hears you and wakes up. She turns into the Fox and starts to come after you.
What do you do?
