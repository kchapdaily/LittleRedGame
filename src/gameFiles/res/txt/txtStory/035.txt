You yell. Then the father of Boy that you played hide and go seek with comes rushing in. He kills the Fox and saves your life. The Boy's Father talks to you.
Boy's Father: My son ran back to town saying he saw the Fox and that you were still out in the woods going to Grandmother's house. He asked me to find you and make sure you were safe.
Good thing you had a buddy on your trip, even if it was for a short time.
