You arrive at Grandmother’s house. You knock on the door and Grandmother asks…
Grandmother: Who is it?
You tell Grandmother that it’s you and she warmly greets you. After you walk in you remember that there is a hungry Fox lurking about. You debate if you want to tell Grandmother about the Fox or not.
What do you do?
