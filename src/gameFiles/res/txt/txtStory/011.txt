You arrive at Grandmother's house. You knock on the door and hear Grandmother's familiar voice...
Grandmother: Who is it?
You answer and she warmly greets you. After you walk in, you remember that the hungry Fox is lurking about. You debate about whether you want to tell Grandmother about the Fox.
What do you do?
