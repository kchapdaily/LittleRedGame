You arrive at Grandmother's house and knock on the door. In a peculiar voice you hear Grandmother.
Grandmother: Come in.
You open the door but you don't see Grandmother there to greet you. You walk into Grandmother's bedroom and she is in bed. You think to yourself that she must be sick, which explains the weird voice. Grandmother doesn't look like herself.
You tell Grandmother that she has big eyes, arms, and ears. After that you tell Grandmother that she has big teeth.
Grandmother: All the better to EAT YOU WITH!
Then Grandmother jumps out of bed, but it's not Grandmother. It's the hungry Fox!
What do you do?
