You walk inside. Mother happily greets you.
Mother: Hello Little Red. Could you please bring this basket of bread and wine to Grandmother? Hurry along now, and be sure to stay on the trail - the forest is dark and full of terrors!
You take the basket from Mother and go on your merry way down the trail.
