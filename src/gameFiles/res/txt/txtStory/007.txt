As you hide, you hear the Boy scream and scamper off. He's kind of a wimp and gets scared easily so you don't think much of it. Since you don't have time to go back for him, you continue down the path and arrive at a fork in the road. The "Path of Pins" to the left and the "Path of Needles" to the right. You know both paths take the same amount of time to get to Grandmother's.
What do you do?
