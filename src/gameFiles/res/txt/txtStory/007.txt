As you hide, you hear the neighbor kid scream and run off. He gets scared easily so you don’t think much of it. Since you don’t have time to go back into town, you continue down the path and get to the fork in the road. The path to the left is the “Path of Pins” and the path to the right is the “Path of Needles.” You know both paths take the same amount of time to get to Grandmother’s
What do you do?
