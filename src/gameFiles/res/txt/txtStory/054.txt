After you cut off the hungry Wolf’s paw, the he runs off. You continue on to Grandmother’s house. When you get to Grandmother’s house, you see that the front door is wide open. It’s a nice day outside and you assume Grandmother has the door open to let in the fresh air. You walk in but you don’t see Grandmother. You cautiously walk into Grandmother’s room and see her sleeping in bed. Then you notice that her hand has been cut off. You realize Grandmother is the hungry Wolf! You yell. Grandmother hears you and wakes up. She turns into the Wolf and starts to come after you.
What do you do?
