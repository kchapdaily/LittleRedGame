As Grandmother Wolf starts to back you into a corner you wield the knife one more time. You take it and kill Grandmother Wolf. Just after you kill Grandmother Wolf the door flies open. Grandmother’s neighbors heard you scream and came running. You turn to the Towns People and then turn back to Grandmother Wolf. But, Grandmother Wolf turned back into Grandmother. The Towns People see Grandmother dead and think you killed her. They kill you because you killed Grandmother.
