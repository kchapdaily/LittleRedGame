As the hungry Fox jumps out of bed, you throw the basket of goodies at him and run out of the house, slamming the door behind you to slow him down. You seek out the friendly townspeople and tell them that the Fox just ate Grandmother. The townspeople run back to Grandmother's house where they kill the Fox.
