As the hungry Fox jumps out of bed you throw the basket of goodies at him to slow him down. Then you run out of the bedroom and out of the house slamming both doors behind you to slow him down some more. You find some of Grandmotherï¿½s neighbor friends. You tell them that the hungry Fox just ate Grandmother. The Towns People run back toward Grandmother's house and find the Fox. Together they kill the Fox.
