As the hungry Wolf jumps out of bed, you throw the basket at him and run out of the house slamming both door behind you to slow him down. You find some of Grandmother's neighbor. You tell them that the hungry Wolf just ate Grandmother. They run back toward Grandmother's house and find the Wolf. Together they kill the Wolf.
