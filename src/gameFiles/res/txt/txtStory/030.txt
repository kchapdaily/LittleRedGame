You decide not to tell Grandmother about the Fox. She asks you to put the basket of goodies down, and open up the window. After you open the window, the Fox jumps through the open window and eats Grandmother. You yell. The door flies open. It's the father of the Boy you played hide and seek with! He kills the Fox and saves your life. The Boy's Father talks to you.
Neighbor Kid's Father: My son ran back to town saying he saw the Fox, and that you were still out in the woods going to Grandmother's house. He asked me to find you and make sure you were safe.
Good thing you had a buddy on your trip, even if it was for a short time.
