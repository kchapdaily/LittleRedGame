You arrive at Grandmother’s house. You knock on the door and Grandmother asks…
Grandmother: Who is it?
You tell Grandmother that it’s you and she warmly greets you. After you walk in you remember that there is a hungry Wolf lurking about. You wonder if you should tell Grandmother about the Wolf.
What do you do?
