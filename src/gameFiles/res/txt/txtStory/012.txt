You decide not to tell Grandmother about the Fox. It's warm inside and Grandmother has you open a window for some fresh air. Suddenly, the Fox jumps through the open window and devours Grandmother whole (she's a tiny lady). You don't know if you should try to fight the Fox yourself, or run and ask the townspeople for help.
What do you do?
