After you pick many pretty flowers for Grandmother, you continue down the trail until you get to the sparkling lake. Seeing the lake reminds you that you are getting close to Grandmother's because she takes you swimming there all the time. You want to go for a quick swim but you know you took longer than you should of picking flowers.
What do you do?
